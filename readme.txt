A plugin to correctly load users custom CSS overrides for The Events Calendar PRO.


== Description ==
A plugin to allow users to add custom CSS without having to either copy all existing code from TEC/ECP core CSS files or add the correct @import to their custom CSS.

Correctly load `{YOUR_THEME}/tribe-events/tribe-events.css`, if it exists, using wp_enqueue_style in proper order when using ECP 3.x.

== Installation ==

1. Create a `/tribe-events/tribe-events.css` file and directory inside your active theme or child theme directory.
1. `/tribe-events/tribe-events.css` only needs to contain the override CSS. No CSS code from any core tribe-events CSS file(s) needs to be duplicated.
1. Upload the entire `/the-events-calendar-user-css/` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the plugin require The Events Calendar plugin? =

Yes. [The Events Calendar plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/) is written by Modern Tribe, Inc. It requires at least The Events Calendar/Events Calendar PRO v3.x.

= Do I really need this? =

No, if you're using The Events Calendar 3.x all you need to do is create the following structure in your theme's folder, `{YOUR_THEME}/tribe-events/tribe-events.css`. This file should contain only the override CSS. It will be loaded automatically by TEC 3.0. If you're trying to override CSS in Events Calendar PRO 3.x then you may need this plugin as the CSS for ECP is loaded after the automatic loading of tribe-events.css. You may also need this plugin if your theme's CSS is overriding your changes.

= Where can I report bugs? =

Add a new topic on the [WordPress Support Forum](http://wordpress.org/tags/the-events-calendar-user-css).
